                    <p>Incredible how some parts of history are condensed into tiny, sometimes cryptic and many times incorrect examples. Take for instance, Marie Antoinette. Most people will know nothing about her, nor about her role in the French Revolution, they will only know the quote, ‘Let them eat cake.’ Yet, apparently there is no record of her ever saying it – it is attributed to a Princess before her time. Even so, whilst untrue it still illustrates why Marie Antoinette is famous, citing the power struggle between peasants and the elite. Other examples include Van Gogh’s ear, Isaac Newton’s Apple, Napoleon’s height and Edison’s lightbulb. While these examples are untrue or exaggerated, they still show that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree – well, except in Newton’s case where it didn’t fall at all.</p>

                    <p>Rasputin is perhaps closer to the mark if we go by the most famous ‘pop-culture’ usage of his name, written by German-Caribbean disco group Boney M, the chorus flows:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Ra ra Rasputin <br />
                            Lover of the Russian queen <br />
                            There was a cat that really was gone <br />
                            Ra ra Rasputin <br />
                            Russia’s greatest love machine <br />
                            It was a shame how he carried on <br /><br />
                            But when his drinking and lusting <br />
                            And his hunger for power <br />
                            Became known to more and more people <br />
                            The demands to do something <br />
                            About this outrageous man <br />
                            Became louder and louder</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>Troubled Childhood</h3>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>Born around 1869, near the town of Tyumen on the European cusp of Siberia, Grigori Yefimovich Novykh grew up on a peasant farm. It was cold, punishing living, with seven of his siblings not surviving through childhood. A theme begins in his early life which dominates throughout his entirety, that much of Grigori’s life is clouded with conjecture based on rumours and eye-witness accounts.</p>
                    <p>Another theme forged is that Grigori had a dark reputation. He was a notorious drinker, womanizer, and a thief but naturally charismatic, handsome too, many saw him as a lovable rogue. Religion and the supernatural were major beliefs back then and Grigori became involved in such mysticism and faith. Villagers believed he could cure horses and speak to God. By adulthood he had married a village girl Prastkovya in 1887, they had four children, the most famous of which would be Maria.</p>

                    <h3>Unholy Preacher</h3>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>At 28, Grigori became obsessed with Religion. The belief of the land was Orthodox Christianity but he delved into offshoots also, embarking on several religious pilgrimages, even venturing as far as Greece on one occasion. His activities made him known among the Orthodox clergy and brought him many followers but also controversies.</p>
                    <p>Some of his teachings were said to be unholy and illicit. For instance, Grigori was accused of joining the Khlysty, a sect which seceded from Orthodoxy. People said they indulged in ritualistic orgies and flagellation. It seems obvious that Grigori was involved in such practices as he requested to be known as ‘Rasputin’ (‘Debauchee’ in Russian), representing that he believed true salvation must be attained through sin. Despite these suspected indecencies, through various connections, he climbed the holy ladder. Grigori moved to St Petersburg (then capital of Russia) where the leader of Russia – Tsar Nicolas II – ruled and formed a close connection with the wanderer.</p>

                    <h3>Mystical Healer</h3>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>Preaching Christianity would be a backstory as Rasputin’s rise was mainly due to curing the Tsarevich, the Tsar’s only son and future ruler. The boy Alexei suffered from haemophilia – meaning he was susceptible to abnormal bleeding. Rasputin drove away doctors, denouncing medicine, calling on religious faith instead and Alexei’s condition improved. The boy’s mother, the Tsarina, cried him a miracle healer making the Siberian’s influence grow, gifting him a flat in the center of St. Petersburg and roles within the government.</p>

                    <h3>Rasputin: The Immortal Monk</h3>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>Controversy still followed Rasputin. Accounts say he was far from coy when taking in prostitutes or even female members of the aristocracy to his flat. He was denounced for devil worshipping, of using the Tsar as a political weapon, even accused of having an affair with the Tsarina. It is said that others including the British accused both him and the German-born Tsarina of being German spies.</p>
                    <p>This is where Rasputin became infamous as the monk who couldn’t be killed. At this time in Russia there were many devout Christians as well as political parties vying for power and someone took umbrage, described as a vagrant, stabbing Rasputin in the stomach. Rasputin survived and the assassin’s motives are still unknown.</p>
                    <p>This attempt would be a prelude for when members of the nobility led by a rumoured cross-dresser named Felix Yusupov attempted an assassination. They believed Rasputin had too much power when the Tsar was out of Russia during the break of World War I. Yusupov invited him to dinner. He poisoned his cakes and wine, shot him three times including once in the head. Still alive, Yusupov rolled him in a carpet, throwing him off the balcony into the sub-zero River Volga. Finally, the monk was deceased. His adopted family the Romanovs did not have time to mourn. A political coup meant that they fled east only to be butchered in a famous assassination in the basement of a winter palace.</p>

                    <img class="raspdead" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQKQw2LFlftV2OanBmlbGzf6x9ZP5iXaSg9AA&s" alt="Rasputin's children" className="image" />

                    <p>His life and motives are impossible to fully comprehend but some light has been shed on his practices. Firstly, the world was a very different place then, where religion and the supernatural were considered truth. And even those who did not believe were forced to follow it for fear of castigation. Rasputin was an extremely charismatic man, mixed with extreme confidence and bravery which of course can get one very far. There are clips online which show famous hypnotists such as Derren Brown showing its power, many believe Rasputin was adept at this.</p>
                    <p>As for the healing, historians have the idea that Grigori’s insistence for doctors to leave Alexei actually helped by giving him rest. And by denying him pain-killing medicines like Aspirin, it thickened his blood. Further afield, are more outlandish claims. In the theme of sex sells, Rasputin’s weapon was believed to be below his belt. A thirteen-inch penis which is said to be on display at the Russian Museum of Erotica after being chopped and swapped among various second parties. And the madness didn’t stop when Grigori died.</p>

                    <h3>Aftermath</h3>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>His daughter Maria fled Russia after her father’s death and became a lion tamer in the US. If sources are to be believed, she named one of her dogs after the killer Yusupov. But that’s another story, as is that of the Romanov family who also proved extremely tough to kill. To learn more about Rasputin, there are many books available including accounts from his daughter Maria, and killer Felix Yusupov. There is a film starring Alan Rickman, an actor worthy of the role.</p>
                    <p>Also, the tale of Harbard in The History Channel’s Vikings is perhaps a homage to the Siberian; a wanderer who heals Ivar the Boneless and then seduces his mother, the Princess Aslaug. As stories of holy wanderers are notorious in all corners of the world, Rasputin was not the first and certainly won’t be the last. But perhaps, he was the strangest. Oh, those Russians…</p>
