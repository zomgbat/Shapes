            <h1>Hakan Sukur – The Superstar Striker Exiled by Erdogan</h1>
            <p className="author">BY GAVIN ALEXANDER • DECEMBER 28, 2018</p>

            <p>Nowadays, top level footballers traditionally lead amazing lives: earning big money, travelling around the world, experiencing a high-class lifestyle. Even more so the case for those who are considered star players, as they are no longer footballers but heroes among their communities. They experience these extraordinary lives but not always in a positive manner due to the intense pressure it carries. And the weight of nations thrust upon them. One of the biggest examples of this, is the turbulent career of Hakan Şükür.</p>
            <p>In the world of football, no-one in Turkey could handle the man who became known as the ‘Bull of the Bosporus’, a fast, instinctive, powerful striker who broke records in both the domestic and international game. His influence skyrocketed and before long he negotiated big-money moves abroad, rubbing necks with the Turkish elite.
            Pressure exemplified when he attempted to wield his status in the political world but when the bullish frontman went against Turkey’s dominant politicians, a power-struggled ensued and a player once hailed the hero of his nation transformed for some, into a disgraced figure. This is the story of Hakan Sukur– a player who realised that the move from sport to politics is not for the faint-hearted.</p>
            <h2>Early Career</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>A child prodigy born in Adapazari, in the northern Maramas region of Turkey, though, he expresses that his roots are Albanian, with his mother and father both emigrating from the former Yugoslavia. In a country extremely impassioned with football but left wanting on the world stage his meteoric rise was met with enhanced reverence. At 21 years old he joined one of the biggest teams in Turkey – Istanbul based Galatasaray SK – immediately becoming a fan’s favourite for his goal ratio. He was gifted the name ‘Kral’ denoting King as he started a journey which would eventually break the scoring records of both Galatasaray and the Turkish national team. Turkey and Hakan went to the 2002 World Cup, hosted in Japan & South Korea as underdogs but with more than a hint of optimism, finishing third which was branded a massive success. Despite Hakan Sukur being a periphery figure he was able to score the fastest goal in world cup history – after 10.8 seconds – in the third place playoff. It is a stat which illustrated his turbulent career; leaving his mark in the history books and further endearing himself to the Turks.</p>
            <h2>Life abroad</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>Big money moves came calling, and were impossible to resist, with the opportunity to play in one of the best leagues in the world (the Italian Seria A). Although many say that Hakan did resist, and that the powers that be – the Turkish football federation and politicians – forced him to leave to promote Turkish football. Hakan ventured to Torino FC first in a move that seemed to fit (even their nickname is Il Toro – The Bull). Alas, as the story goes, he became homesick in Turin and so everything he craved from Turkey was accommodated to cure this – even, a wife.</p>

            <h2>His wedding day</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>Their now celebrity wedding was televised in a splendorous ceremony, performed by Erdoğan and Cleric Gülen, the latter would act as Sukur’s best man. Yet, back in Italy, the strained relationship lasted only four months and Esra returned home. She was branded a thief by Sukur who accused her of stealing his jewellery and the last we heard of the girl was in 1999. She died in the Izmit Earthquake which took the lives of 17,000 people in and around Istanbul, aged only 24. Her parent’s lives were also claimed.</p>

            <h2>Later career</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>After only one goal with Torino, Hakan Sukur returned to Turkey.  Who knows what must have been going through his head but this failure abroad would be a common trend. After dominating again in the Turkish Süper Lig he was again tempted by another Italian Club – Milanese giants Inter Milan. Again, he would flop, though perhaps by struggling to oust star strikers Christian Vieri and the Brazilian Ronaldo Nazario. He would try England as his last foray to foreign lands being signed by former Galatasaray manager Graeme Souness but scored just two times following a leg break. Every time he went abroad Hakan struggled but always found a way to remain in the hearts of the Gala and Turkish faithful when returning. As every time he came back to Istanbul he continued where he left off scoring for fun, eventually winning 14 titles with Gala including their maiden European success – the 1999 UEFA Cup. With the Turkish national team, he retired as top scorer with 51 goals in 112 games, and top scorer for Gala with 288 goals. (https://www.transfermarkt.com/)</p>
          
            <h2>Life in politics</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>After his retirement Suker turned to politics, working for the AK Party (Justice and Development Party) – which Erdoğan still represents. To understand what happened we must understand the conflict between Erdoğan and Gülen – which is far from easy. At the time of Sukur’s employment, the Cleric Gülen was also a member of the AK Party, with hopes of turning Turkey back into a more Islamist state. Erdoğan and Gülen had a close and potent partnership. While the former worked his way up the political ladder, Gülen had amassed a wealth of power after privatisation, notably with many media companies. A schism came to a head in 2016 when a coup d’état was staged. Among it came a corruption scandal in which the AK Party themselves were accused of corruption – the President’s family also. Gülen – who was and remains based in the US – was deemed the figure behind it – a terrorist organisation called FETO. He was accused of trying to oust out his former ally Erdoğan.  Gülen fervently denies this but many of his followers were arrested and his thought-schools shut down across the country. Hakan Sukur did not agree with this accusation and when asked to renounce Gülen, he refused. He was also quoted as calling himself Albanian and not Turkish which lost him support in an increasingly nationalist movement. He resigned from the AKP to start work as an independent MP.</p>
            <h2>Where is Hakan Sukur now?</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>Because of his actions, a warrant was issued for Hakan Sukur’s arrest. He escaped but his father Selmet was not so lucky and became imprisoned. There are reports he has since died inside. Sukur was able to emigrate to the USA and has bizarrely opened a bakery in Palo Alto, California. Judging by the pictures of his lifestyle he has been more than able to retain some of his assets, staying in a 3 million dollar home with his current wife and 3 kids. There are also plans to make his bakery into a chain. It is fortunate for him, as a return to Turkey is simply not possible in this climate.  </p>
            <h2>Final Note</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>There are many stories of people falling from grace in the history of the world. Sometimes it is deserved and sometimes not. This story certainly ranks high in terms of a fallen star but it is impossible to comment on whether it is justified. In a political sense, it seems very harsh for Hakan to be punished as he was. In a human sense his relationship with Esra looks to be extremely badly-judged but only they will know the truth of what transpired. At worst, if we go by the mantras of forgiveness, with a new family and new business to oversee we can only hope Hakan Sukur and his family finds solace in their lives, helped with a wonderful career to look back on.</p>
            <h2>Writer’s Note</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>The relationship between Hakan and Esra is extremely clouded with few sources. Perhaps there are some Turkish readers who can tell us more, please let us know in the comments if so. Also, regarding Erdogan and the Gulen movement, it is a very delicate and complicated situation so we apologise if we have anything incorrect.</p>
