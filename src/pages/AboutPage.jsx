                    “I’ve always been impressed that we’re here surviving because of the indomitable courage of quite small people against impossible odds: jungles, volcanos, wild beasts… they struggle on, almost blindly in a way.”

“I love history and I always feel, you, even when you walk into a room you really ought to know the history, but, not only [of] the room but [of the] people, we walk in, with all this tremendous history behind us… It’s an added power in this world.”

J.R.R Tolkien from an interview with Denys Guerolt in 1968

Most stories are taken from ststworld (my old employer who stopped paying me and dissapeared) – where the idea came from – but all stories are researched, edited and written by myself. Feel free to write and send your own.
