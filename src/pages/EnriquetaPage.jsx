             <p>Serial Killing is a terrifying subject, to know people exist with those tendancies – thankfully an extremely low amount alas extremely unnerving neverless. To that point it is an important subject, important in the hope that understanding may lead to abolishing, or at least minimising. It is thought-provoking because the more we read, the more correlations we discover. Take the fact that three out of the four most prolific serial killers ever caught and recorded were born in Colombia. Their murders ranging from 90-300 bodies. Does this say something about the socioeconomics of a country? It would appear to be a massive co-incidence if not. And then take a seemingly safe country like Spain who does not have a large history of serial killers, with the most prolific convicted of sixteen. Would the obvious historical factors come into play here or is it something beneath the surface?
                <br></br> <br></br>
                Let us take a look at one of Spain’s serial killers – the Vampiress of El Raval – to see if that helps us discover more…
                <br></br> <br></br>
                In a metropolitan, port-side area in Barcelona called El Raval there is an enchanting yet eerie quality about its narrow, odorful streets when you walk them. Ravalito – famous for its never-ending nightlife which unfortunately brings about illegal prostitution as well as petty crime. It now houses around 50,000 people and retains a bohemian yet illicit reputation – I know because I used to live there.
                <br></br> <br></br>
                Transport back to the 1900’s and these notions of eeriness and enchantment would heighten considerably. As would the element of fear which no doubt increased considerably during 1912 when a wave of Catalan children went missing, amid rumors of a vampire escalating through the barrio. At this time the population of Barcelona was skyrocketing. Raval, also known as El Chino (Chinatown) became home to many immigrants as well as war veterans and deserters, seeking solace from the Spanish-American War – fought on Moroccan soil. There was a week of protests in 1909 known as the Tragic Week in which there were strikes leading to riots then eventual occupation by the National army.
                <br></br> <br></br>
                Barcelona was becoming a famous harbour town known to many as the ‘Pearl of the Mediterranean’ meaning hotels and brothels were flourishing. El Raval became a hub between other developing cities such as New York and Rio de Janeiro. The streets were full of orphans and thieves, children even sold by their parents due to economic struggles, mostly ending up in sweatshops.
                <br></br> <br></br>
                This way of life created a desperate situation. And fresh on the minds of the populace was Spain’s first documented serial killer- Manuel Blanco Romasanta – who killed twelve people north of the Portuguese border. Claiming to be a wearwolf, Queen Isabella II allowed him to be examined. Soon after was Juan Diaz de Garayo, a strangler of five women and one girl in the northern Basque region of Spain. His nickname was Sacamantecas – a boogeyman figure – along with ‘Hombre del Saco’ who had the myth of eating children. A different mindset back then in terms of the supernatural was prevelent. Other stories such as Jack the Ripper from across the sea in England would also be widely publicized.
                <br></br> <br></br>
                When more children than usual began to go missing, the police started investigating. Enriqueta Martí i Ripollés was brought to the attenton of the authorities however was not pressed. Some said her connections with the elite of Barcelona got her off the hook.</p>
            <br></br>
            <h2>History of Enriqueta Martí</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>Martí did not have a strange upbringing or childhood, reports would suggest. Born in Sant Feliu de Llobregat, on the outskirts of Barcelona in 1868 she moved to the city in her 20’s to become a maid and nanny but turned to prostitution shortly after. In 1895 she began a failed marriage with painter Juan Pujaló who stated that she had a strange character as well as affairs with other men.
                <br></br> <br></br>
                Her most lucrative work came as a procurer for the rich and famous of Barcelona. She was prepared to get them anything and this disregard for humanity gave her a unique position. It highlighted her to people with deep pockets and perverted desires with such desires driving a hard price. Martí was prepared to do anything including kidnapping children to sell to such people. She gained access to the high life and was able to operate in famous places like the El Liceu theatre and the now abandoned Casino de la Arrabassada on the hills of Barcelona . There were rumors that she was a practicing witch doctor also, using the remains of her captives to make potions and elixirs.
                <br></br> <br></br>
                Martí did her work very stealthily and it was not until 1912 when she was caught out. A feeling in the community that the police were not doing enough to find the captured children meant there was a public effort to find a girl called Teresita Guitart Congost. She was part of a popular local family and had been missing for two weeks. A neighbor of Martís called Claudia Elias began to watch her movements. One day Elias saw a girl peering out the window of Martí’s apartment. Martí denied the claims when asked by Elias which arose even more suspicion. It was reported to the police who then found Marti and forced her to the flat on Carrer Minerva, indeed revealingTeresita Congost as well as another girl called Angelita. This is where the crimes of Enriqueta came to the fore.</p>
            <h2>The Rescue of Teresita Congost</h2>
            <br></br> 
            <p>Let it be known that the following testimonies come from the police and because of the times were not recorded. For that reason, the claims cannot be verified and some have even disputed them. Martí said she found the young girl Teresita lost and hungry so decided to care for her. However, Teresita told the police that Martí cut her hair after forcing her to the flat, telling her that her new name was Felicidad and that her parents had gone.

                Martí claimed the other girl Angelita was hers but her ex-husband Juan Pujaló would later disclaim this. The girls told the police that their captor would only feed them potatoes and bread. She would pinch them if they misbehaved such as going to the windows, balconies or other rooms.  Those other rooms told a story even darker than kidnapping. The girls were first to explore them in their bored isolation beforehand and so guided the police inside. There they found bloody clothes and a evidence to incarcerate the supposed vampiress. A variety of small bones, many of which exposed to fire. Jars with strange contents, reported as blood, bones and hair. Angelita also spoke of a young boy called Pepito who she witnessed being killed by a knife on the kitchen table by Martí.
                <br></br> <br></br>
                Enriqueta Martí was sent to the infamous Reina Amalia prison, sentanced to punishment of death by garotte. Before this end she tried to commit suicide by cutting her wrists without success. More of her secrets were unraveled within the jail.

                She gave locations of her previous abodes bringing about more evidence: Carrer dels Tallers, Carrer Picalques and Jocs Florals –all of which rented with fake names. They were all composed of false walls with condemning features behind: Human remains, bones, books with recipes and potions in beautiful calligraphy, coded letters and a list of famous names. People believed it to be a list of her clients who would buy children or potions. However, it is said that the authorities did not act on this for fear of retribution from the wealthy. They said instead, it was people that Martí tried to swindle.</p>

            <p>The prisoner began to tell the truth probably knowing she had no reprieve. She first claimed she studied anatomy but then indeed confessed to use the remains of children to make potions for the elite. Tuberculosis was a big killer and many believed that drinking young blood could cure it. She told police where to find everything. Yet she did not name any of her clients and never admitted to killing anyone. More witnesses came forward once Martí was ousted. A woman from the region of Aragon said Martí kidnapped her son six years ago after befriending her in Barcelona. A son she never saw again.</p>
            <h2>Death and Aftermath</h2>
            <br></br> 
            <p>After fifteen months in jail, it was proven that the Vampiress was far from immortal as her life was ended prematurely on May 12, 1913; either to illness or at the beating of her cellmates. Her body was buried in the Montjuic Cemetery albeit secretly marked.

                There ar people who dispute the claims of the police. For example, Elsa Plaza’s El Cielo Bajo Los Pies (The Sky Underfoot) is one such work which argues the Marti’s innocence, or at least that she was not responsible for the murders. Many who have scrutinized the story closer believed that the police used Enriqueta Martí as a scapegoat for all the crimes sweeping through El Raval which they could not solve. Recent research has demonstrated that the only thing that can be proved about Martí is her kidnapping of the young girl, Teresita Guitart.

                Plaza states Martí was never formally charged nor were any actual corpses found in her flats. She argues the blood on the clothes could have been Martís as she was suffering from uterine cancer and that the bones were most likely animals. Martí confessed to prostituting a girl of seventeen years on Carrer Sabadell as well as performing abortions but claimed to never have killed anyone. Plaza goes as far to say the trial was staged to wrap up the murders. More recent works points to Martí being a scapegoat, a strange character immersed in the dark arts but not a killer.</p> 
            <p>Enriqueta Martí remains one of Spain's most notorious criminals, often referred to as the "Vampiress of El Raval."</p>
           
            <blockquote class="quote1"> <p><em>“She is a female killer, which is very unusual because 99 percent of serial killers are men.”</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>–Says Marc Pastor, a CSI agent who worked to imprison a serial killer called Remedios Sanchez in 2006</p>
            <p>It is extremely doubtful that Enriqueta Martí will ever be concluded as a serial killer. She was however, without a doubt involved in the horrific events involving children of El Raval.</p>
