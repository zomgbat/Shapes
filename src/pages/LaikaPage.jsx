                    <br></br><p>We all know the names Buzz Aldrin and Yuri Gagarin for being – conspiracies aside – some of the first people into outer space. The Russian, Yuri Gagarin is considered the first man to orbit Earth in 1961 then in 1969 the Americans: Aldrin and co-pilot Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon, with Michael Collins in lunar orbit. They paved the way for what is now a golden age for space travel with ideas hatching for passenger flights and plans to colonize other planets. But who paved the way for them?</p>
                    <br></br> <p>Less is known about their counterparts, animal astronauts who have also voyaged – albeit forced – into the unknown, many in the name of the Space Race between the aforementioned countries. The most famous of these was a little Russian dog called Laika. In a time when conditions in space were unknown, Laika was chosen as a ‘Guinea Pig’ before any human had made the jump, picked from the streets of Moscow to join the Russian space mission Sputnik II in 1961.</p>
                    <h2>Why Laika?</h2><br></br>
                    <p>According to the crew, Laika was around three years old when selected, a mongrel female and unlike her name suggests [Barker] remained very quiet. Found in the Russian capital, her exact breed is unknown but almost certainly a cross between a terrier and husky. Stray dogs were commonly used in preparatory missions previous due to their obedience and subsceptance to cold temperatures. The program also picked a small female in terms of space-saving (for a spacecraft about the size of a washing machine, even leg-lifting was a factor). The good-natured mutt was quickly loved, birthing several Russian nicknames including Kudravka meaning Curly, Damka – Little Lady and Limonchik for Little Lemon. Muttnik would be her catchy handle in the English speaking world.</p>

                    <p>The spacecraft Sputnik II would launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in modern-day Kazakhstan to test various cosmic conditions as well as the effects of space travel on animals. The first Sputnik mission proved a success in orbiting the Earth unmanned with the second vowing to go further with a living creature in tow. Ultimately, Laika was a precursor to Yuri Gagarin, whose mission was already in the pipeline. Previous missions included fruit flies, monkeys and dogs but reached suborbital conditions only before briefly returning, Sputnik II was a major step up. Veteran pups of those missions including a hound called Albina were to be backups behind Laika. (Rumours say the crew got too attached)</p>
                    <h2>Preparation for launch</h2>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>As launch day approached, news of the voyage spread, as did the darkness which clouded it. There were protests around the world criticising the lack of humanity involved. Such a mission today would cause an uproar, by modern terms completely inhumane. Alas, it was a different time back then, especially behind the Iron Curtain, with fewer objections aided by Cold War secrecy, Space Race obsession and a lack of red tape. Presumably, there would have been more protestation if people knew the truth, that returning to Earth was never planned for Laika (a secret until 2002).</p>
                    <br></br><p>The crew have spoken more about this in recent times. They claim that the Soviet Union leader at the time – Nikita Khrushchev – urged them to speed up the mission to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution. It made several plans impossible to complete but Khrushchev was not a man to argue against. Whilst staying professional it is clear to see that the crew came to love the dog. They made a plan to euthanize her with a poisoned last meal if she suffered too much. They also constructed a window on board, surplus to the mission. One scientist and trainer, Dr. Yazdovsky wrote that he took Laika home to play with his children on the night before launch.</p>
                    <blockquote> <p><em>‘Laika was quiet and charming… I wanted to do something nice for her. She had so little time left to live.’</em></p>
                    </blockquote> <h2>Laika in space</h2>
                    <p>The next morning was a Red Letter Day as the crew lamented and said their goodbyes. Sputnik II launched and up flew Laika, beyond the realm of Earth, into Outer Space, into the unknown. Everything on board was monitored including Laika, at the start of the expedition her heart understandably raced leaving Earth’s atmosphere but soon after, she started to calm. Her heart slowed and she continued to relax, more once reaching weightlessness. For the first time ever, a living mammal was orbiting Earth, and of all creatures, a dog. Laika had made history. Within her harness, floating in zero gravity, Laika would have seen the blue and green of Planet Earth the way no-one had seen it before. Perhaps she knew it was trees and water. Of course, the dog would be oblivious to the incredulity of events, and there is no doubt it was a traumatic experience but at least Laika felt some relief shown by her breathing, she even enjoyed some food. Then disaster finally struck. Her little heart started to race as temperatures rose, then panic must have took over. Five hours into the voyage, with no pulse detected, she was at peace.</p>
                    <p>The technicalities of her death are varied, with it simply claimed that overheating due to certain machine failures occurred. Laika’s death would have been a relief to many of the scientists once problems arose. The capsule became her coffin and after five months, with over 2,000 orbits, the craft disintegrated upon reentry to Earth in 1958.</p>
                    <h2>Later developments</h2>
                    <p>Her death did not go unnoticed. As time went on reforms took place, future space missions carrying animals were made to be recovered after Laika’s death weighed heavy on the conscience. The brutality of the mission has forced many people to look back with regret none more so than the crew. Scientist Oleg Gazenko explains,</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“Work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us. We treat them like babies who cannot speak. The more time passes, the more I’m sorry about it. We shouldn’t have done it … We did not learn enough from this mission to justify the death of the dog.”</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Making such a difference for the greater good of the world would have been lost on Laika but she contributed more than most to the development of our world. Not for space exploration but in terms of awareness and animal rights, this little terrier became a martyr.</p>

                    <p>Laika made the world remember that whatever we can achieve, we must do so humanely. She is immortalised in Star City, Russia, at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. There, a statue has been erected while all around the world Laika has been immortalized on items from posters and stamps, to cigarettes.</p>
                    <p>Cпасиба Laika, rest in peace.</p>
